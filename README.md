# minesweeper-java
Minesweeper is a single player game. In this game we have a field (grid with squares) with some hidden bombs and the goal is to open/clean all the squares without a bomb and if the player hits a bomb, then s/he loses the game. If the player can open all the squares without a bomb, then s/he wins the game!
